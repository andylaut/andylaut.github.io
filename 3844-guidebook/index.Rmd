# Introduction
Welcome to English 3844: Writing and Digital Media! In this class we write blogs, create podcasts and videos, and then curate all of this content on our own websites.

This booklet contains instructions and resources related to English 3844: Writing and Digital Media. Inside you'll find instructions on how to install and use Atom text editor, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub pages, as well as a few readings and a collection of audio and video development resources.

I'll add more and more content to this booklet as the semester progresses.
