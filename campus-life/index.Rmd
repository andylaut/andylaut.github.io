# Navigating Blacksburg Transit
![Photo of a Bus](http://gdurl.com/YAxO)

**```Authored By:``` ```Josh Rasco```**

## Introduction
> *This document aims to instruct students on how to plan a trip via and travel on Blacksburg transit buses.*

The bus system can seem complicated and intimidating for students, but this manual can help! Blacksburg transit is the cheapest, and often the easiest method of transport for Virginia Tech students. This manual will help to clarify the issues most students have, and guide the reader through using **Google Maps** to assist in bus travel.

The document is organized in the following fashion:

* Planning the Trip
    * Bus Hours
    * Via Phone
    * Via Computer
* Finding the Bus Stop
* Boarding the Bus
* Choosing a Seat
* Notifying the Bus Driver of Your Stop
* Common Issues
* Conclusion

## Planning the trip
### Bus Hours
![Bus Hours](http://gdurl.com/tMNM)

### Via Phone

The quickest and easiest application to plan a bus trip on the phone is Google Maps. This manual will use **Google Maps**, available for both smartphone and computer users. **Google Maps** has the most accurate times and also factors in the walking distance to and from the bus stop.

1. Open the application on your smartphone

2. Type in the address of your destination in the location bar at the top of the screen

   * A list of auto-completed locations will appear as you type, which you can select by tapping when the destination address appears

3. Press “Directions” in the bottom right corner of the screen

   * The start location defaults from your current location using your phone’s built-in location service, this can be changed by pressing the bar at the top of the screen which says, “Your location” and typing in where you plan to start your trip from

4. Underneath the location search bars, there is a mode of transportation selection, you should select the one with the bus icon ![Transit Icon](http://gdurl.com/XfLI)

5. The app automatically sets the time for the current time, to plan ahead, there is a "depart at" selection below the mode of transportation selection, from which the app will find the closest route to the entered time

   * If you are planning a trip days in advance, the timing can be less accurate, be sure to check the bus schedule on the day of

6. Tap on the best route for yourself, and the phone will display detailed directions on a map

>**Note: For Android phone users, another option to consider is VT4U.**

### Via Computer

1. Go to this link: maps.google.com

2. Type your destination into the location bar located in the top left corner, and select the correct address as it is auto-completed below the location bar

3. Press the "Directions" button

4. Similar to the destination, a location bar will appear for the starting location, just type in and select the address

5. The default transport directions are for cars, so select the bus icon ![Transit Icon](http://gdurl.com/XfLI)

6. Below the location bars, you should see a dropdown box, which reads, "Leave now," clicking this and selecting "Depart at" will allow you to specify the time and date you plan to leave

7. Click on the best route for yourself, and the website will display detailed directions on the map

ridebt.org, another option, has an updated live map, routes and schedules, and hours and service information, which gives an easier way to plan trips far in advanced, but seems to have less accurate times. This website serves as a good resource for Blacksburg transport information not available in this manual.

## Finding the Bus Stop

On **Google Maps**, bus stops are listed as blue symbols with a white bus

Often the bus stop will have a small, covered structure, but not always

Bus stops are marked by a sign, which lists the stop location and a list of operational hours, shown below
![Bus Stop Sign](http://gdurl.com/gPGt)

Don’t wander too far from the stop, as buses can drive past stops with no passengers

## Boarding the Bus

Be sure to have Hokie Passport on hand.

The bus will be marked with a three letter code near the top of the front of the bus, which will match the **Google Maps** schedule, shown below

![Front of the Bus](http://gdurl.com/4LLD)

1. When the bus approaches, wait, standing at the bus stop

2. After the bus stops, board the bus from the front entrance

3. Show the bus driver your Hokie passport as you board the bus

    * As a Virginia Tech student, the cost of travel on Blacksburg transit is pre-paid
    * If you forgot to bring a Hokie passport, the bus fare is $0.50 (exact change)

## Choosing a Seat

Sit in the innermost seat, to leave room for other passengers, unless the bus has few passengers.

You should be respectful of other passengers.

Standing is also an option. The bus has several poles to hold onto to balance yourself as the bus moves and turns.

If someone has their belongings on the seat next to them, and the bus is full, politely request for them to move their items so you can sit.

## Notifying the Bus Driver of Your Stop

The inside of the bus has both a yellow pull cord, located near the windows, and sometimes a red button marked stop on the inner bus poles

![Inside of a bus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Inside_a_bus_of_Blacksburg_Transit%2C_Blacksburg%2C_Virginia.jpg/1600px-Inside_a_bus_of_Blacksburg_Transit%2C_Blacksburg%2C_Virginia.jpg)

1. Pull the yellow cord downwards or press the button after the previous stop to the destination, which sends a notification to the bus driver that someone wants to be dropped off at the next available bus stop

> **Note: The** Google Maps **phone application will update your location as you travel, so you can view how far you are from your destination. In this view, bus stops along the route are represented by solid,  white circles**.

2. Leave the bus through the set of doors closest to you, that is not the front set

3. Thank the bus driver as you walk off the bus for the sake of politeness

## Common Issues

**Missed bus**  
For common locations, many locations will have bus route overlaps, so check for other options.

**Bus is running late, and you have another bus to catch**  
Talk to the bus driver when you board, they call other bus drivers and request for them to wait for you.

**No buses are going to your destination, or traveling outside of bus hours**  
Look into Lyft and Uber, as paid alternatives. More information available at [this Smarter Travel guide](https://www.smartertravel.com/how-to-use-uber-lyft/).

**Riding a bike**  
Blacksburg buses have bike racks on the front.This can be viewed in the **Boarding the Bus** section above.

## Conclusion

Count on this manual to get you through the process of navigating the Blacksburg transit system. For other questions, don't fear questioning friends or the bus driver about the system!

# Doing Laundry in a Dorm
 
![image alt](https://gdurl.com/xIDh)

```Authored By:``` ```Jay Klustner```

## Purpose

> *In this document, you will learn the ins and outs of doing laundry as a college student at Virginia Tech.* 
 
Life on campus can be difficult. Dorm rooms are small and access to things you would normally have at home is limited. After classes, homework, and extracurricular organizations, it's crucial to leave some time to yourself to socialize and have fun. This leaves accomplishing mundane tasks such as laundry very little time. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to streamline your laundry routine to not only leave you more time, but to also take better care of your clothes at the same time. Don't be scared of laundry anymore - take control.
 
The document has been organized in the following fashion:
* Materials
* Washing your clothes
* Drying your clothes
* Ironing your clothes
* Closing
 
## Materials

> *This section contains a list of the items that you will need, why you will need them, and alternatives to them.*

* Laundry Detergent
	* This will depend on the type of washing machine. Luckily,     however, all of the washing machines on campus are front-loading, high efficiency ones, meaning that you can use the typical high efficiency detergents sold in stores.
 
	> **NOTE: My preferred choice is to use laundry pods, which is easier to carry than a whole jug of liquid laundry detergent. My personal favorite ones are the [Tide Free & Gentle](https://www.amazon.com/Tide-Gentle-Laundry-Detergent-81-load/dp/B00VRAF7ZU/ref=sr_1_6_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1540172773&sr=8-6&keywords=laundry+pod) pods. I don't like my clothes to smell strongly of detergent, so these work best for me.**
	
* Stain Remover Spray
	* Any old stain remover will work. What matters is that you treat the stain as soon as possible so that it does not set into the material. I will go into more detail on treating stains in the section titled "Washing your clothes".
* Dryer Sheets
	* These aren't 100% necessary, but they do reduce static and make your clothes smell good. Similar to laundry detergent, I prefer the unscented variety.
* Access to washing machine
	* This is assumed since you are living on campus, but double check and make sure there aren't too many people using it at the same time. I always found Sundays to be the most busy and during the day over the weekdays to be least busy. Find what works for you.
* Starch
	* Starch is used to add crispness to your clothes when you iron them. This is another optional material. I have found, however, that starch helps prolong the life of the creases that you iron into your clothes. More on that in the section titled "Ironing your clothes".
* Iron
	* People often splurge when it comes to irons. They are compelled to buy a certain iron based on often gimmicky features. I'm not saying that these features don't work, what I'm saying is that as a college student, money is tight - don't spend too much on features you don't need.
	>**WARNING: Make sure that the bottom surface of your iron is clean. Even the smallest amount of residue or buildup can result in stains on your clothing.**
* Ironing Board
	* The same said about the iron is true about the ironing board. You can save money here. Make sure the surface is clean and the base is sturdy.
 
## Washing your clothes
> *This section provides step-by-step instructions for cleaning your clothes, from before the clothes go into the washing machine to after you take them out.*
 
1. Sort your laundry  
This step is dependent on how what kind of clothes you wear. Everyone is different. Whites should be separated to prevent bleeding from colored fabric. To wash more clothes in a load, you can wash on cold. This allows you to mix colors because bleeding isn't an issue with cold water. Only do this if you are trying to be more efficient. See the image below for more information on what the tag on your clothes actually means.

2. Once it's all sorted, add the first load to the machine. Be sure nothing is crumpled up too much so that it gets washed well.
3. After everything is in, put in your preferred detergent. If it is a pod, add it directly to the load inside of the machine. If it is liquid, add it in the tray above labeled "Wash".

4. Select your cycle. I recommend either cold or warm for most items, hot for your dirtiest.
5. Press start and make note of how long the cycle has left so that you can promptly switch loads when it has completed.
 
## Drying your clothes
>*Now that your clothes have been cleaned, it's necessary to figure out the best way to dry them. Drying is the number one cause for wear and tear on your clothes. It's the reason why your formally soft t-shirt is no longer soft. Dryer lint is literally the fabric from your clothes coming off. The less lint that accumulates, the better.*


### Delicates
These include anything made of special fabrics or ornate knits. Wool is the best example of this. The best way to dry these types of clothes is to let them air dry, just be sure to allow them as much air flow as possible, don't just set them on a table or else they could get mildew.

### Items that you will be ironing
What I like to do with my dress shirts and pants is take them out at about halfway. This makes ironing a lot easier as they are at the perfect level of dampness. It also allows more airflow for the rest of your clothes, so they will dry more effectively.

### Soft clothing
The best example of this would be soft t shirts, basically items that you want to stay the same texture for a long time. I take them out along with the clothes that will be ironed, but instead of ironing them, I lay them out to dry with the delicates.

### Normal clothes
Though you will most likely want these to dry as fast as possible, avoid the urge to put them in on high heat. Low heat is the best option, even for sturdy clothes. As long as you don't overfill the dryer, they will dry in plenty of time. Recall what I said about dryer lint earlier. This will help your clothes last a long time. This is especially important given the clothes you are most likely wearing. College student don't have as much money to spend on clothes, so typically they purchase clothes that won't last as long as high quality brands. There's nothing wrong with this; we just want to make sure that you make the most of your purchase and extend the life of those clothes.

### Towels
Towels are usually the last thing to dry because they are so absorbent. Keep them in as long as possible.

## Ironing your clothes
>*Now that you've taken your clothes out of the dryer, it is important to get them ironed out as to prevent unnecessary wrinkling. Be sure to have your ironing board set up, iron plugged in and set to high, and starch on hand if you choose.*
 
>**WARNING: It is important to always keep the iron in motion to avoid burning your clothes.**

### Shirts
1. Start with the collar. Flip it so that the side that touches your skin is face down on the board. Begin ironing by firmly pressing the iron in the middle of the collar, then work your way to the edges.

2. Move to the panels. This includes back and the two front panels. Lay them flat on the board and iron firmly.

3. When you are done with all three panels, move to the sleeves. Unbutton the wrist buttons and lay the sleeves as shown in the picture below. Iron each sleeve until smooth.

### Pants
1.  Fold lengthwise at the first two belt loops and the middle belt loop in the back. This is how you find the proper placement of the crease. The ending fold should result in a crease down the middle of each leg in the front and back. Please reference the pictures below for further clarification.

2. Lay down pants on sides so that the creases you just created form the edges of the pants. Each leg should be laying on top of each other. See below for further clarification.

3. Lift up the top leg so that only one leg is on the board.

4. Begin ironing by firmly pressing the iron down onto  the fabric. Be sure to maintain the same crease line the whole way up the leg. Keep the ironing moving and firmly pressed to prevent the fabric from getting too hot and potentially burning.
5. When you finish the first leg, flip onto the other side and do that side.

## Conclusion
I hope that this guide will make your laundry routine more effective and efficient. Maintaining your clothes is an important life skill. Find what works for you and stick with it.
