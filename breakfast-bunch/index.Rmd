In only 30 minutes, you can make yourself 9-10 cups of granola to grab-and-go for the week. Add milk to enjoy your granola as a breakfast cereal, add it to your favorite yogurt for an extra crunch, or put it in a plastic bag to snack on throughout the day!

Granola is becoming the new boxed cereal. Not only is it better for the wallet but its the smarter for your health. As college students, it's rare that you have time to set aside to make breakfast or lunch at home. Taking just thirty minutes at home can save you hours of waiting in dining hall lines, while also satisfying your midday sweet tooth craving. Packed with fiber and iron from the oats, the nuts and seeds add protein and unsaturated oils that are good for your heart! While some granola brands load up on added sugar, this homemade recipe contains only natural sweeteners. This is definitely a snack that you can turn into what you want. Use your imagination with this dish, it's so easily turned into a variety of meals and it's up to you to determine what you want. Enjoy!
