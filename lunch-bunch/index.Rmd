# Rigatoni with Ricotta and Spinach
![Placeholder image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Spinach_and_ricotta_cannelloni.jpg)

This pasta dish is quick, easy, and serves as a great alternative to over-processed jarred pasta sauce. Yielding 6 servings for about $10, this works well within a tight (or not-so-tight!) budget.

**Prep Time: 5 min**
**Cook Time: 10-12 min**
**Estimated Cost: $10**

***

## Ingredients

Rigatoni | 1 lb  
Fresh Baby Spinach | 6 oz  
Ricotta | 2/3 cup  
Minced Garlic | 2 cloves  
Olive Oil | 2 tbsp  
Red Pepper | 1 tsp  
Salt and Pepper | to taste  

***

## Directions

1. Add 6 quarts of water to a large pot. Turn the heat setting to ‘HIGH’.
2. Once the water has come to a rolling boil, add the ridatoni and 1 teaspoon of salt to the pot. Reduce heat to ‘MEDIUM-HIGH’.
3. Stir the pasta every few minutes until it is cooked al-dente, or to your personal taste. The pasta should be boiling for a total of 6-8 minutes. Once fully cooked, remember to turn the heat to ‘OFF’.
4. Strain the pasta in a colander and return it to the pot.  

    > *NOTE: Do not rinse the rigatoni! The starches from the pasta help adhere the sauce to the noodles. For more information and tips about the best ways to cook pasta, click [here](https://www.rachaelraymag.com/food/how-to-cook-pasta).*

5. Pour 1 tbsp of olive oil into a large skillet or pan and set to ‘MEDIUM’ heat. Add minced, or finely chopped, garlic.  

    > *NOTE: If you do not wish to mince the garlic yourself, you can use a garlic press or purchase pre-minced garlic in the produce section of your local supermarket.*

6. Add one bag of fresh baby spinach to the skillet and cover. The spinach will shrink considerably, so do not worry if your skillet is too small.
7. After 2 minutes, stir the spinach and remove from the heat. The spinach should look wilted and wet.
8. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, the contents of the skillet, oil, salt, pepper, red pepper, and any preferred additional seasoning. Mix until all ingredients are evenly spread.
9. Pour the contents of the mixing bowl into the pot and mix thoroughly.
10. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Clean Up / Storage

* Although a colander may not _look_ dirty, bacteria can still live and breed on it. Be sure to clean your colander along with all of your other dirty dishes.
* This dish can be split up into multiple, small storage containers as a “meal prep” for the week. Otherwise, one large storage container will do for any leftovers.
* Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days. After this point the food is still safe to eat, but the pasta will have gone crusty.

**prep time: 10 min**

**cook time: 15 min**

**Estimated Cost: $10

***

## Required Kitchen Tools
* Skillet
* Knife
* Cutting Board
* Spatula
* Measuring cups
* Forks

## Ingredients

Ingredient | Quantity
:- | :-
Chicken | 1 breast
Olive oil | 2 tablespoon
Flour Tortilla | 2 large
Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese | 1 cup
Salt | 
Pepper | 
**Optional Toppings** | 
Tomato | ½ 
Onion | ½
Bell Pepper | 1 pepper
Mushrooms | ½ cup
Corn | ½ cup 
**Optional Dips** |
Sour cream | ¼ cup
Salsa | ¼ cup
Guacamole | ¼ cup


## Directions

### Chicken Preparation

> *NOTE: If you are short on time, you may use an already cooked rotisserie chicken instead of a chicken breast and skip to step 5. If you choose to do this, you will  not need the whole chicken and will need to find another use for the unused meat.*

1. Add 1 tablespoon to a large skillet (a flat pan) on medium heat.  A skillet is pictured below if you are unsure what this pan is.
![skillet](http://gdurl.com/uc7Q)

2. Add the chicken breast to the pan and let cook for 5 minutes.  If you move the chicken too early it will stick to the pan.  Not moving the chicken also helps prevent the chicken from drying out when you cook it.
3. While the chicken is cooking begin the Ingredients preparation steps
3. Flip the chicken breast and let sit for another five minutes. This will ensure an even cook which will give a consistent juicy flavor to your chicken.
4. Let chicken sit for another 5 minutes before cutting. This prevents juices from escaping when you cut the chicken which would negate all our efforts to keep juices in the chicken.
5. Shred the chicken.  This can be done by taking 2 forks and pulling at the chicken to separate the fibers of chicken.  Refer to the image below for assistance.
![shredding chicken](http://gdurl.com/2leZ)

6. Set chicken aside until later needed

### Ingredients Preparation
1. Choose which optional toppings you would like to include in your quesadillas. These are listed above in the ingredients table
2. Rinse and dry your chosen toppings
3. Dice your chosen toppings. To dice, cut the vegetable along all three axis with half an inch between each cut. It will be easiest to cut horizontally (parallel to the cutting board) first. Then cut up and down, rotate your vegetable and cut up and down again
4. Set diced toppings aside until needed again

### Quesadilla Cooking
1. In the same pan the chicken was cooked in, add the last tablespoon of olive oil and move the pan to spread the oil evenly.
2. Place one tortilla flat in the pan
3. Add ½ of each of the diced optional toppings you chose to the tortilla. Only put toppings on one half of the tortilla.  You may choose choose which toppings you wish to include.  

    > *NOTE: Make sure not to pile ingredients too tall such that you will not be able to fold your quesadilla*

4. Add ½ of the shredded cheese to the same half of the tortilla as the other ingredients.  
5. Once the cheese has began to melt, fold the tortilla in half over the ingredients. 
6. Press on the top of the quesadilla with your spatula. This will allow the top half of your tortilla to stick to the cheese so your quesadilla will not fall apart when you try to eat it.

    > **CAUTION**: The pan will be HOT. Do this step using a spatula.

7. With a spatula, flip the quesadilla and toast the other side of the tortilla, this should only take 30 seconds. It may take longer depending on how many toppings you have included.

    > *NOTE: If when you flip your quesadilla, the tortilla is not a golden brown, leave the quesadilla toasting until it is*

8. Remove the quesadilla with a spatula and set aside. You can save yourself from cleaning some dishes if you place the quesadilla onto the plate you plan to eat of off.
9. Repeat steps 2-7 for the other tortilla and other half of your ingredients. 

> *NOTE: Remember to turn of the stove after use*

1. Place 1 quesadilla on each plate
2. Cut the quesadillas into thirds as shown in the figure below
![cutting guide](http://gdurl.com/zr8v)
