Volkswagen is only having trouble with one of there new models.<br>**Volkswagen is having trouble with only (adverb placement) one of its (a company is an "it," not a "they") new models.**2. The grand marshal gave his counsel to whoever sought it.<br>**The grand marshal gave his counsel to whoever (this is the subject of the verb "sought," so it needs to be "whoever") sought it.**3. Only one of the people who work in the lab is a veterinarian.<br>**Only one of the people who work in the laboratory (spell out on first reference; thereafter, "lab" is fine) is a veterinarian.**4. He claimed he knows a star athlete who will sign with the school.<br>**He said ("said" is neutral and always the best choice in journalism) he knew (sequence of tenses) a star athlete  who would (sequence of tenses) sign with the school.**5. He felt bad due to the unhygienic accommodations.<br>**He felt bad because of ("because of" was previously preferred in constructions like this one, but few people know that anymore and so won't be distressed by "due to") the unhygienic  accommodations.**6. He looks like he can pitch real good.<br>**He looks as if he can pitch well (use an adverb, not an adjective, here).**7. Travelling across the U.S., it's vastness effected her.<br>**Traveling (one "L" is the preferred U.S. across  the United States, she ("she" was the one traveling, so "she" needs to be the subject of the main clause to avoid a dangling participle) was affected by its (possessive "its" takes no apostrophe) vastness.**8. Like I said, he should be like I and do like I do.<br>**He should be like me (object) and do as ("as" is preferred over "like" in this kind of construction) I do.**9. He wanted to know if the criteria is valid<br>**He wanted to know whether (if it's a yes/no situation rather than a conditional, "whether" is preferred) the criterion ("criteria" is plural; "criterion" is the singular) was (sequence of tenses) valid.**10. Joe told his wife Alice he likes his mistress better than her.<br>**Joe told his wife, Alice, (assuming Joe has but one wife, her name is an appositive that needs to be set off with commas) that he liked his mistress more (liking is a matter of quantity, so use "more" or "less," not "better" or "worse") than her.**11. The hero was presented with an historic award by the Congressman.<br>**The hero received (an active construction is better here) a historic (use "a" when you pronounce the "h") award from the congressman (lowercase).**12. This is different than and hopefully more preferable over that.<br>**This is different from (use "from" in most cases with "different") and hopefully (in modern usage, "hopefully" is acceptable to mean "it is hoped") preferable  to (use "to" and not "over" with "preferable") that.**13. Its easy to see the difference between she and I.<br>**It's easy to see the difference between her and me (these are objects of the preposition "between," so they need to be the objective pronoun forms).**14. We must try and keep up with the Jones.<br>**We must try to ("try to..." instead of "try and...")  keep up with the Joneses (one Jones, two or more Joneses).**15. What kind of a woman could like those kind of men.<br>**What kind of (no need for the indefinite article here) woman could like that kind (If "kind" is singular, the rest of the phrase needs to be also) of man? (this is a question and so needs a question mark)**16. The principle reason for Lopez' dismissal was because he behaved weird.<br>**The principal  reason for Lopez's (form the possessive with apostrophe-s) dismissal was that ("reason" implies a cause, so "because" is unnecessary) he behaved weirdly  plus an adverb is needed here, not an adjective).**17. Neither her or him know how to play the ukelele.<br>**Neither she nor he (these are subjects and so need to be the subject pronoun forms) knows (singular verb, because we're talking about "she" or "he," not both) how to play the ukulele.**18. Have you got a receipt for a clam chowder soup which won't make me <br>nauseous.**Do you have (preferred over "have you got") a recipe for clam chowder (chowder is soup, so "chowder soup" is redundant) that won't make me nauseated ("nauseated" once meant feeling ill and "nauseous" once meant inducing nausea, but "nauseous" has shifted in common usage to also mean feeling ill, so either is OK. Or change to "won't nauseate me.")?
