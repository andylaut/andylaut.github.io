					<h2>Instructions</h2>	
					<p>A few notes you won't get from a textbook</p>
					<p><small>(Click arrow icons or use arrow keys to navigate slideshow)</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We've already learned quite a bit about instructions, but honestly the hardest part of writing instructions and other user documents—and maybe even writing in general—is the distance between the inside of your own mind and everybody else's.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You have to move from a <em>writer</em> mindset to a <em>user</em> mindset.</p>	
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 1: The illusion of explanatory depth</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>First, how well would you say you understand how a bicycle works? Just a simple, single-gear bike. Rate your level of understanding from 1 (no understanding) to 10 (certainty). Keep that number in mind.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now copy this picture of the bike on a piece of paper (or on your <a href="https://sketch.io/sketchpad/" target="_blank">computer</a>). Complete the bike by drawing the frame, gear, and pedals where they belong on the bike.</p>
					<img src="bike-1.png" alt="bike stick figure" />	
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now, having completed your sketch, rate your understanding from 1 to 10 again. If you're second-guessing yourself, pick a lower number. If you feel even more confident, pick a higher number.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now try choosing the correct configuration below.</p>
					<img src="bike-2.png" alt="bike multiple choice" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The correct answers are
						<ol start="3">
							<li>1</li>
							<li>2</li>
							<li>4</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now rate your understanding from 1 to 10 once more.</p>
					<p>How did your confidence change? Here's how a previous class did:</p>
					<img src="bike-3.png" alt="bike poll (v shape)" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Note how confidence decreased by half a point after students had to actually <i>draw</i> the bike. That overconfidence is what we call</p>
					<h2>The illusion of explanatory depth</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						The <b style="color: #E5751F">illusion of explanatory depth</b> means that people <i>think</i> they know how something works until they have to <i>explain</i> how it works. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You may think writing a set of instructions on, say, assembling a piece of Ikea furniture would be easy, but as Ikea customers worldwide will testify, it is not easy.</p>
					<p>If writing instructions feels easy, beware: You may not be thinking like a user.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 2: The Curse of Knowledge</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Does this sound familiar?</h2>
					<p>Your professor lectures for a long time, writing some stuff on the board. Prof keeps going, finishes the proof or whatever, then turns to face the class like, "<i>Everybody got it?</i>"</p>
					<p>You get the feeling that nobody in the class "got it." You also get the feeling that prof has no clue that nobody got it.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You've just witnessed</p>
					<h2>The curse of knowledge</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The <b style="color: #E5751F">curse of knowledge</b> means that when you deeply understand something, you may have a <i>very</i> difficult time imagining how other people will struggle to understand the same thing.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Freeman Dyson, a stone-cold genius physicist, was once asked how he felt when he realized as a child that he was so much smarter than everyone else.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>His response? “That’s not how the question phrases itself. The question is: why is everyone else so stupid?”</p>
					<p>He didn't mean that in a snide way. He just meant that when he was young, his own mind was his only yardstick.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You'll be surprised by they ways in which users will fail.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>For instance, I once had some students publish an email newsletter. The task was new to them.</p>
					<p>I wrote some instructions, but I got all kinds of questions like</p>
					<h2>How do I publish my newsletter?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Here's what the newsletter's compose window looked like:</p>
					<img src="newsletter.png" alt="Tinyletter compose window with red Send Now button" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>I thought the red button was pretty obvious, but</p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>I'd been using the term <i>publish</i>, while the service uses the word <i>send.</i></li>
						<li>Some people did push the button but then didn't immediately receive notification that their letter had sent.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>What is obvious to you will NOT necessarily be obvious to users.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 3: Problems of scale</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>How do you walk?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Put one foot in front of the other? For many people, it's not that simple.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>What if you couldn't?</p>
					<p>What if you used a wheelchair?</p>
					<p>What if you were a amputee veteran?</p>
					<p>What if you had bad knees or hips, or plantar faciitis?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>What if you're the guy from <a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html" target="_blank">QWOP</a>?</p>
					<p>In fact, many, many people need instructions on how to walk, or to walk better.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We tend to imagine that</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Others have knowledge similar to ours</li>
						<li>Others have motivations similar to ours</li>
						<li>Others have abilities similar to ours</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When we're working on a large scale, these assumptions will sooner or later prove false.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Murphy's Law</h2>
					<p>Given enough trials, anything that can go wrong will eventually go wrong. Any flaw <i>will</i> be exposed.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Murphy's Law speaks to <b style="color: #E5751F">problems of scale</b>. And because your instructions will live on the internet. they will be accessible at a worldwide scale.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Too much info?</p>
					<p>Too little info?</p>
					<p>Very old users?</p>
					<p>Reading on phone instead of laptop? At a large scale, these could all become problems.</p>	
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Perfection is unattainable. The optimal is the best you can hope for.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 4: Acheiving the optimal</h2>
					<p>(Last part, I promise!)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>1. Know your audience</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Never forget who your users are and how they differ from you</li>
						<li>People who aren't your users don't matter, but you don't always know everything about all your users.</li>
						<li>You're not writing to some "general public" but to a bunch of different real, living people.</li>
						<li>Use the rhetorical analysis worksheet you completed and (coming soon) personas</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>2. Ask what could go wrong</h2>
					<p>Every sentence, every word can potentially cause problems. Here are just a few:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do you have users who may not speak English as their primary language?</li>
						<li>Do you have users who may not understand technical terms?</li>
						<li>Do you have users who will be following your instructions on a phone?</li>
						<li>Do you have users who use the metric system instead of the American system?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Examples</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Maybe users won't know where to obtain materials.
							<br>Link to online shops.
						</li>
						<li>Maybe users won't be familiar with terminology.
							<br>Provide a glossary, define/explain terms as you introduce them, or link to definitions/explanations of terms as you introduce them.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>3. Provide feedback</h2>
					<p>Use illustrations AND sensory detail to explain what the project should look like at a given point</p>
					<p>For ex., "Cook garlic until just aromatic. Do not allow it to brown."</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>4. Test your instructions</h2>
					<p>The ONLY way to truly know if your instructions work optimally is to find users, ask them to use your instructions, and get feedback.</p>
					<p>If you can't do that, then at least test against the concepts outlined above:</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><b>The illusion of explanatory depth</b><br>
						Explain your task to a friend and note where you have trouble explaining.</li>
						<li><b>The curse of knowledge</b><br>
						You are most likely more capable than your users. Look for uncommon words, complicated sentences, etc. You understand the task as a whole; they're working a step at a time.</li>
						<li><b>Problems of scale</b><br>
						Imagine as many common use cases as possible. Focus on your target audiences most of all, but don't forget about edge cases.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You can't anticipate every problem, and even if you could, trying to address to every possible issue could lead to complicated, unusable instructions.</p>
					<p>But you can address some, if you can inhabit the minds of your audience members.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now return to the Canvas module and continue working on your instructions project.</p>
