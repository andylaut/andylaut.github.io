					<h2>Instructions: an intro</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The point of this lecture is to begin to move you from a <b>writer</b> mindset to a <b>user</b> mindset.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 1: The illusion of explanatory depth</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>First, how well would you say you understand how a bicycle works? Just a simple, single-gear bike. Rate your level of understanding from 1 (no understanding) to 10 (certainty). Keep that number in mind.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now copy the picture of the bike on a piece of paper (or on your <a href="https://sketch.io/" target="_blank">computer</a>). Complete the bike by drawing the frame, gear, and pedals where they belong on the bike.</p>
					<img src="bike-1.png" alt="bike stick figure" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now, having completed your sketch, rate your understanding from 1 to 10 again. If you're second-guessing yourself, pick a lower number. If you feel even more confident, pick a higher number.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now try circling the correct configuration below.</p>
					<img src="bike-2.png" alt="bike multiple choice" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The correct answers are
						<ol start="3">
							<li>1</li>
							<li>2</li>
							<li>4</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now rate your understanding from 1 to 10 once more.</p>
					<p>How did your confidence change? Here's how a previous class did:</p>
					<img src="bike-3.png" alt="bike poll (v shape)" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Note how confidence decreased by half a point after students had to actually <i>draw</i> the bike. That overconfidence is what we call</p>
					<h2>The illusion of explanatory depth</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						The <b>illusion of explanatory depth</b> means that people <i>think</i> they know how something works until they have to <i>explain</i> how it works.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If writing instructions feels easy, beware: You may not be thinking like a user.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 2: The Curse of Knowledge</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The <b>curse of knowledge</b> means that when you deeply understand something, you will have a <i>very</i> difficult time imagining how other people will struggle to understand the same thing.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="newsletter.png" alt="Tinyletter compose window with red Send Now button" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>I thought the red button was pretty obvious, but</p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>I'd been using the term <i>publish</i>, while the service uses the word <i>send</i></li>
						<li>Some people did push the button but then didn't immediately receive notification that their letter had sent</li>
					</ol>
					<p>What is obvious to you will NOT necessarily be obvious to users.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 3: Problems of scale</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's play some <a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a></p>
					<img src="qwop.png" alt="QWOP /">
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>People who might need instructions on how to walk:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Amputees</li>
						<li>People injured in accidents</li>
						<li>Elderly people</li>
						<li>People with chronic foot, leg, hip, and/or back pain</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Which of these people do we want to help?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Murphy's Law</h2>
					<p>Given enough trials, anything that can go wrong will eventually go wrong. Any flaw <i>will</i> be exposed.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="text-align:center;">1-(1-p)^n</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Perfection is unattainable. The optimal is the best you can hope for.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Part 4: Acheiving the optimal</h2>
					<p>(Last part, I promise!)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>1. Know your audience</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Never forget who your users are and how they differ from you</li>
						<li>People who aren't your users generally don't matter. There is no "general public"</li>
						<li>Use the rhetorical analysis and personas to get to know your users</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>2. Ask what could go wrong</h2>
					<p>Every sentence, every word can potentially cause problems. Here are just a few:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do you have users who may not speak English as their primary language?</li>
						<li>Do you have users who may not understand technical terms?</li>
						<li>Do you have users who will be following your instructions on a phone?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>3. Test your instructions</h2>
					<p>The ONLY way to truly know if your instructions work optimally is to find users, ask them to use your instructions, and get feedback.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If you can't do that, then at least test against the concepts outlined above:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>The illusion of explanatory depth</b><br>
						Explain your task to a friend and note where you have trouble explaining</li>
						<li><b>The curse of knowledge</b><br>
						You are most likely more capable than your users. Look for uncommon words, complicated phrasings--never forget your bottom quintile of users</li>
						<li><b>Problems of scale</b><br>
						Imagine as many common use cases as possible. More on this later</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now return to the Canvas module and complete the remaining steps!</p>
