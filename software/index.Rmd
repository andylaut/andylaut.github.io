# PyDev Installation Guide For Windows
_Kent McDonough_

These instructions will guide you through setting up Python 3.7.0 to run in Eclipse 4.8. After you are done, you will be able to develop Python inside an Eclipse workspace like any other native Python IDE. This guide will not cover the download and installation of Eclipse. Please reference the [Eclipse Installer Download Page]([https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)).

> *Disclaimer*: This procedure may be different for legacy or future releases of Python and Eclipse. Additionally, some Eclipse plugins may change the appearance of menus and toolbars. This document will use a stock version of Eclipse with no additional modifications.

This procedure is divided in two parts: **Installation of Python 3.7.0** and **Configuring Eclipse**. Users who have previously installed Python 3.7.0 may wish to skip to Section 2 - however, some familiarity with the procedures in Section 1 will be assumed.

### Checking Windows' Current Python Version
1. Open a PowerShell window by right clicking the Windows icon on the taskbar, then clicking 'Windows PowerShell’.

2.   ```python --version``` and hit enter. If you see an error similar to the one below, you **do not** have python installed. If you see an output similar to the one at the end of Section 1 Step 6, you already have Python installed. Users who have previously installed Python 3.7.0 may skip to Section 2.

## Section 1: Downloading Python
1. Navigate to [The Official Python Downloads Page for Windows]([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

    ![Figure 1:](https://gdurl.com/BNKz "Python Download Webpage")

2. Download version 3.7.0. You should receive one file, named ```python-3.7.0.exe```.
    
    > *Note*: The yellow download button might show a different version. Specific releases are on the bottom on the page, if version 3.7.0. is not the main version.

3. Run the ```python-3.7.0.exe``` executable.  
Depending on your security settings, you may need to click "*allow this app to make changes to my device*" in order to continue.

4. At the bottom of the first dialogue, click the **Add Python 3.7 to Path** option.  
Then click "Install Now".  

    ![Figure 2:](https://gdurl.com/PVOP "Python Installer on Windows 10")

5. When the installer is finished, click "Close".

6. To make sure your Python has installed successfully, reopen PowerShell and type ```python --version```. The output should now look like:

    ![Figure 3:](https://gdurl.com/M6tj "Valid Python Version")

    > If you still see an error message, try closing and reopening the PowerShell window. PowerShell must refresh to display the most recent information about your computer.
