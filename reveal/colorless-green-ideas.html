				<section>
					<p>Here's a classic sentence from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" target="_blank" alt="Noam Chomsky">famous linguist:</a></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Colorless <span style="color: #DAF7A6">green</span> ideas sleep furiously.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Why is this sentence famous?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Because it makes no sense. Colorless and green?</p>
					<p class="fragment"><b><span style="color: #DAF7A6">Contradiction</span></b>. Green ideas?</p>
					<p class="fragment"><b><span style="color: #DAF7A6">Makes no sense</span></b>. Ideas sleeping?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Sleeping furiously? <b><span style="color: #DAF7A6">Makes no sense</span>!</b></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>And yet</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Can't you almost see it? <span style="color: #DAF7A6">Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.</span></p>
					<p class="fragment">Something <em>doing</em> something—actor, action.</p>
					<p class="fragment">It's a <em>good</em> sentence.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You can almost see it because:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Every word means something your mind can grasp.</li>
						<li class="fragment">The sentence uses actor > action form. Something is <em>doing</em> something.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Contrast these two sentences:</p>
					<div class="fragment">
						<ul>
							<blockquote>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.</blockquote>
							<blockquote>It has been observed that ideas, colorless and green, are in a simultaneous state of sleep and fury.</blockquote>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Why is the second harder to read and picture? Why does it feel less <em>real?</em></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Because it uses too many abstract words, and it doesn't contain much action.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<blockquote>It has been observed that ideas, colorless and green, are in a simultaneous state of sleep and fury.</blockquote>
					<p class="fragment"><b>Where's the actor? Where's the action?</b></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>What is "it"? Can you picture what "it" stands for?</b></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>"Been"? What does it mean to be?</b></p>
					<p class="fragment"><b>Quick! Define "in." <span class="fragment">Define "of."</span></b></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>These little words like <em>be, of, that</em>—these words often feel abstract, hard to picture.</p>
					<p class="fragment">They have <em>functions</em> more than meanings. Their purpose is to show relationships between words that <em>do</em> mean.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>So why do so many students (and working adults!) write more like this:</p>
					<blockquote class="fragment">
						It has been observed that ideas, colorless and green, are in a simultaneous state of sleep and fury
					</blockquote>
					<p class="fragment">Than this:</p>
					<blockquote class="fragment">Colorless green ideas sleep furiously</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Maybe because standardized tests overemphasize word count, or because students are trying to hit assigned page minimums. Maybe because some people associate abstraction with intelligence and want to sound smart.</p>
					<small class="fragment">(Btw, you'll not only sound smarter if you write my way, you'll eventually <em>feel</em> smarter, because your thoughts will become more vivid even to yourself.)</small>
					<p class="fragment">My best guess comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead" target="_blank" alt="Alfred North Whitehead">famous philosopher's</a> quote:</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<blockquote>
						<span style="color: #DAF7A6">We think in generalities, but we live in detail.</span> To make the past live, we must perceive it in detail in addition to thinking of it in generalities.
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Great writers know how to express that detail. Reading them feels like looking through a clean window.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Those function words like "am," "to"—you need them, but too many will make the window dirty. They are Scotch Tape on the window. They hold the glass together, but ain't nobody here to see them.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>When you use words to paint detailed pictures—when you use words your readers <em>can</em> picture,</p>
					<p class="fragment">ideas, even impossible ideas</p>
					<p class="fragment">like <span style="color: #DAF7A6">"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"</span></p>
