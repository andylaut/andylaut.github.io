						1.
					</small>
					<p><b>If you want something, find out who can give it to you, figure out what they want, and give it to them.</b></p>
					<p><small>The people who can give you what you want are your main audience. What do they need to hear in order to be moved to change?</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>2.</small>
					<p><b>There is no "general public," just many different audiences with different needs.</b></p>
					<p><small>You can appeal to many audiences simultaneously, but you must treat each as distinct. What does each one need to hear?</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>3.</small>
					<p><b>If you want to reach someone different than you, first understand the difference.</b></p>
					<p><small>Other people are not mere reflections of you. They have their own values, areas of knowledge and ignorance, and emotional triggers. Personas can help you see your audiences as real people.</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>4.</small>
					<p><b>Help people find what they need, understand what they find, and act on that understanding.</b></p>
					<p><small>How will people find your work? How will they know it's relevant to them? How will they know what to do with your work? Find out what your audience is searching for, and use titles, intros, metadata, and other elements to say, "I made this for YOU."</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>5.</small>
					<p><b>"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."</b></p>
					<p><small>Write vivid sentences built on concrete nouns and action verbs, and avoid when possible be verbs, vague pronouns, and long strings of prepositions (e.g., "I should finish by Friday" rather than "It is in the process of being completed and should be finished by Friday.")</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>6.</small>
					<p><b>Use the affordances of the medium.</b></p>
					<p><small>A blog post is not an English paper posted on the web. A podcast is not a blog post read into a microphone. A video is not a podcast with a camera pointed at it (well, sometimes it is, but still...). Every medium has unique qualities, unique ways to appeal to an audience. Use those affordances.</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>7.</small>
					<p><b>The medium is the message.</b></p>
					<p><small>When Marshall McLuhan said the above, he meant that forms of media <em>themselves</em> reshape our minds and our societies. For ex., the medium of the web opens up certain ways of seeing, thinking, and doing, but it also forecloses others. (Think of how the web created an astonishing network of associations, and also how platforms like Facebook and TikTok create individual user experiences rather than shared communal experiences.)</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>8.</small>
					<p><b>Who's holding the lamp, and what are they wishing for?</b></p>
					<p><small>Having vast amounts of information about vast numbers of people is like having a genie in a lamp. With a little rhetorical skill, you can turn people against each other, make them believe mis/disinformation, and just generally con them. You can also do the opposite. Look closely. How are powerful forces shaping you?</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>9.</small>
					<p><b>Revision <em>is</em> creation. Erasing <em>is</em> writing.</b></p>
					<p><small>Learning is the process of trying something, getting feedback (from teachers, audiences, user tests, and even from yourself), and trying again. The difference between good work and great work often comes down to how easily you as a creator are satisfied.</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<small>10.</small>
					<p><b>You can learn to do virtually anything.</b></p>
					<p><small>Guidance is just a web search away; you just have to know enough to know what to search for. Learn the fundamentals, then learn whatever else you need to do from people who have already done it. Follow models and adapt them to your situation. Remember, "Derivative, with a twist."</small></p>
