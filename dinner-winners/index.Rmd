This dish is perfect for the winter when you need something warm but you don't have time to cook all week

### Ingredient List
* 1 (1-pound) box of spaghetti
* A pinch of salt
* 1 tablespoon of butter
* 3/4-pound of lean ground beef (10-15% fat)
* 1/2 tablespoon of onion powder
* 1 tablespoon of garlic powder 
* 1 (16-fluid ounce) jar of marinara sauce
* 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese
* 1 cup of shredded Mozzarella cheese

```
WARNING: This recipe contains dairy products, 
do not consume if you are lactose intolerant.
```

### Kitchenware Needed
* Large pot (~1 foot deep)
* Perforated spoon
* Strainer
* Large (at least 10 inches in diameter) non-stick skillet 
* Wooden spoon 
* 3-quart oven-proof ceramic or glass dish
* Oven mitts or potholders

### Preparation Method
1. Preheat your oven to **350 degrees F** (175 degrees C).
	> *NOTE*: Be sure to do this first as it will take some time for your oven to heat up. You don't need to do anything else to stop it from heating, it will stay at 350 degrees on its own.
	
2. Preparing the spaghetti:
	 1. Fill your pot with water, leaving about an inch between the water and the top, and place it on a larger burner on your stove-top to boil. Set the eye to medium-high heat. Add a sprinkle of salt to the water to initiate the bubbling.
	 2. Once the first bubble surfaces, break the uncooked spaghetti in half and drop it in the pot.
		 > **CAUTION**: Do not put your hands over the steam coming off of the water. You can get burns from steam similar to those from touching hot surfaces.
		 
	 3. Boil for **8-10 minutes** while occasionally stirring until the spaghetti is cooked. Try a piece (be sure it's cool before you try it) to check if it's done; if there is no resistance to you biting it, the spaghetti is cooked.
	 4. Strain the spaghetti over your sink and then add it back to to the pot. Add the tablespoon of butter to the spaghetti and stir it in until it melts. This ensures that the spaghetti will not clump up.
		 > **CAUTION**: You will want to lit the boiling die down a little before straining the spaghetti as a good amount of steam will be released when the water makes contact with the sink. The cooler the water is the cooler the steam will be.
		 
	 5. Set aside for later and turn off the eye you were using. Don't worry about the spaghetti getting cold, it will be reheated when it is baked later.
3. Preparing the meat sauce:
	1. Place the skillet on another large burner set to medium-high and begin cooking your ground beef in the skillet. Place the whole patty in the skillet and break up the ground beef with your wooden spoon so that the ground beef is evenly dispersed in the skillet. You want all of the ground beef to be in contact with the skillet.
		> **CAUTION**: Place the skillet so the handle is pointed *away* from you. You don't want to accidentally bump the handle and knock the contents of the skillet all over the floor.
		
	2. Sprinkle the garlic and onion powder *evenly* over the ground beef and mix in with the ground beef using the same method you used to break up the ground beef. 
	3. Cook, while stirring regularly, until the ground beef is browned but still juicy. Break up some of the ground beef to make sure it isn't pink in the middle. If it begins to blacken and dry out the ground beef is overcooked.
Properly cooked ground beef looks like this:![Properly cooked ground beef](http://gdurl.com/FVPh)
	4. Lower the heat to low setting and add the marinara sauce. Mix the sauce and the ground beef thoroughly. Let the sauce simmer (slight bubbling of the surface) for **2-3 minutes**. 
		> *NOTE*: If you feel your ground beef is close to overcooked, aim for 2 minutes rather than 3 as the simmering will continue to cook your ground beef. 
		
	5. Take the skillet off of the eye once the simmering is done. Set  it aside and turn off the eye you were using.
4. Baking the dish:
	1. Pour your meat sauce into the large pot containing the cooked spaghetti. Add in your grated Parmesan before thoroughly mixing the sauce and spaghetti using the perforated spoon. Be sure to mix the entire pot so that the sauce is distributed evenly over all of the pasta.

	2. Transfer the spaghetti and meat sauce mixture into the oven-proof dish. Use the wooden spoon to get all of the mixture out of the pot and even out the mixture in the dish. The surface should be level throughout the dish.
	3. Evenly coat the top of the spaghetti and meat sauce with our shredded Mozzarella so that you cannot see the spaghetti underneath. Make sure the cheese layer is even or else the spaghetti will not bake evenly. Using your oven mitt or potholder, place the dish on the middle rack of your oven so that it isn't too close to the top or bottom heat sources. 
	4. Let the spaghetti bake for roughly **30 minutes**. Check the spaghetti regularly after the **20 minute mark**. You do not need to wait the full 30 minutes. You will know it's done when you see the cheese bubbling slightly. It is okay if the top layer of cheese gets darkened, it will not affect the taste.
	5. Carefully remove the dish once the spaghetti is done and turn off the oven.
5. Let the dish cool for at least **5 minutes** before serving but do not let it get cold, this dish is best served fresh out of the oven. This dish can be served right out of the dish that you baked it in using a large spoon. The dish can be slightly messy to eat so it is best served in bowls.
6. Store this dish either in the dish it was baked in or a smaller bowl covered with plastic wrap. Keep refrigerated. This dish contains 6 servings but it *should not* be kept past 6 days time.

### Kitchenware

 - Large pot (~ 1 foot deep)
 - Large strainer
 - Medium pot (~1/2 foot deep)
 - Medium whisk
 - Large baking pan
 - Measuring cups

### Preparation
1. Place the medium pot on a large burner on the stove and slowly pour the cold milk into the pot. Then, turn the stove on to medium heat.

    > **CAUTION**:  Never touch a burner with your hands when it is on or has been recently used. When using the stove always be mindful of which burner you have turned on.

2. Measure and add the flour into the medium pot with the milk and proceed to whisk them until the flour is no longer lumpy.  

    ![How to Whisk](http://gdurl.com/eqhJ "How to Whisk")  

    > *Note*: A whisk is a common kitchen tool that seems obvious to use, but can be misleading. When talking about whisking the milk it is advised to use a side to side motion as referenced by the arrows in the diagram. Some people may use a beating or stirring motion, but it is recommended to move your whisk side to side until the desired thickness is reached.

2. Once the flour and milk are whisked properly add slowly add slices of cheese one at a time until they melt. While they are melting continue to whisk the mixture. Once the slice of cheese melts continue to repeat until all the cheese is melted in the medium pot.

    > *Note*: While you are melting the cheese you can simultaneously cook the pasta shells in step 4 to save you time. 

3. Fill most of the large pot up with water (~3/4 full) and place it onto the stove beside the medium pot of milk/flour/cheese. Now, turn on the burner for the large pot on high heat. After **3 minutes** depending on your stove your water should be at a rolling boil.  

    > *Note*: Placing a lid on top of your pot of water can speed up the boiling process. However, once the water is at a rolling boil be sure to remove the lid.  

    > **Caution**: Turning on the burner to a high heat can be dangerous and may cause some water to overflow when boiling. Be sure to monitor the water while cooking and if this situation occurs pour out some of the water until it is no longer boiling over the top.  
![Rolling Boil](http://gdurl.com/PXqi "Rolling Boil")  
The term rolling boil means when so many bubbles are being produced so fast from the bottom of the pot, that stirring won't impact their production. The bubbles get to be very large as seen in the photo above.

5. Once the water is at a rolling boil add the shells pasta to the large pot and lower the burner to medium heat. The pasta should take **~12 minutes** to cook, but it varies depending on heat and exact amount of water or pasta.  
![Cooked vs. Raw pasta](http://gdurl.com/ohcw "Cooked vs. Raw pasta")  
The pasta on the right side of the image is raw pasta and is not edible. However, if cooked for the proper amount of time it should look like the pasta on the left side of the image. When cooking your pasta check every couple of minutes after ten minutes to see if your pasta is completely cooked.

6. Now turn off the heat, drain your pasta from the large pot by using the large strainer.  

    ![Draining Pasta](http://gdurl.com/OWoM "Draining Pasta")  

    > *Note*: To drain your pasta you must take your pasta from the large pot and place it into the strainer as seen above. Before you do this you should have your strainer in the sink so that all the water drains into the sink. After you have finished draining your pasta you can place the strainer with pasta inside on top of your large pot.

7. Preheat your oven to **350 degrees Fahrenheit**. While your oven is waiting to heat up add the cooked pasta and drained pasta into a large baking pan. After the pasta has been put into the pan add the cheese sauce on top of the pasta.  

    > *Note*: If you are looking for a way to make this dish a bit healthier or add some flavor consider adding some broccoli to your mac and cheese. This can be done by cutting up broccoli into small pieces and adding it your baking tray before it is placed into the oven.

8. Once your oven is preheated then you may place your baking tray into the oven for **25 minutes**  

    > *Note*: While the mac and cheese is cooking in the even it advised for you to start cleaning up all the kitchenware and other items used while making this dish.

9. Carefully remove your mac and cheese from the oven and let it cool for **10** minutes. After this you are now ready to serve your delicious mac and cheese. Typically it is served using a large serving spoon and plates, but these are optional.
